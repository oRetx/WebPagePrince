        <p class="albtext">Batman is the eleventh studio album by
            American recording artist Prince and the soundtrack album to the 1989 film Batman.
            It was released on June 20, 1989 by Warner Bros. Records.
            As a Warner Bros. stablemate, Prince's involvement in the soundtrack was designed to leverage the media company's
            contract-bound talent as well as fulfill the artist's need for a commercial (if not critical) revival.
            The result was yet another multi-platinum successful cross-media enterprise by Warner Bros., in the vein of Purple Rain.
            The album was No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart for six consecutive weeks.
            It has sold over eleven million copies worldwide.
            In 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Prince's songs and music videos for Batman,
            more so than the film itself, stating that his songs "suggest a goofy, perverse, sensuous, somewhat introverted Batman
            film that so far we've never gotten from anyone", and arguing that Prince's music videos
            "are more psychologically perceptive than any of the Batman films."[11][12][13]</p>
